title: Embedded Image & Storage
---

flashVM embeds a minimal Python OCI image as package data.

On first use, the image is imported into local containers-storage:

- Preferred path: `skopeo copy oci:/path/in/wheel containers-storage:localhost/flashvm`.
- Fallback: buildah-based import when `skopeo` is unavailable.

Notes:
- Rootless mode uses your userâ€™s containers-storage. Check with `buildah images`.
- Transports `oci:` and `containers-storage:` are standard; see containers-transports manpage.
