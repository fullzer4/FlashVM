title: Artifacts
---

Collect output files produced by your code inside the microVM.

- Files should be written under `/work/out` in the guest.
- Pass one or more globs via `expect=["out/*.txt", "out/reports/**"]`.
- Returned artifacts include the guest path, a temporary host path, and file size.

```python
res = fvm.run(code, expect=["out/*.txt"]) 
for a in res["artifacts"]:
  print(a["guest_path"], a["host_path"], a["size_bytes"]) 
```
