title: Isolation & Security
---

Each run occurs inside a microVM launched by krunvm (libkrun/KVM), offering stronger isolation than namespaces-only containers.

- Dedicated VM process per run.
- Minimal userspace image.
- Limited host surface via standard transports and build tools.

Review krunvm/libkrun documentation for threat model and platform support.
