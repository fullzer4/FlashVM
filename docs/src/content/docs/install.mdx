title: Installation & Requirements
---

flashVM runs short Python snippets inside a KVM microVM (via krunvm/libkrun) and ships a minimal Python OCI image embedded in the wheel.

## Requirements

- Linux host with KVM enabled (check `/dev/kvm`).
- Host tools installed:
  - krunvm — launches microVMs from OCI images (uses libkrun/buildah).
  - buildah — rootless image operations and local containers-storage.
  - skopeo (optional, recommended) — fast copy from `oci:` to `containers-storage:`.
- Python 3.8+.

## Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install flashvm
```

## Install from source (dev)

```bash
pip install maturin
maturin develop
```

Note: krunvm/buildah/skopeo are installed via your Linux distro (not pip).
